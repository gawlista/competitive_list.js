# competitive_list.js

The code for the library is not yet standalone ready. I have to implement a npm & grunt-contrib-coffee workflow to compile CoffeeScript and then I can outsource the code from here: https://github.com/volontariat/voluntary/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/voluntary/dom_manipulation/competitive_list.js.coffee

For now you can play with this plugin here: http://jsbin.com/mihemu/1/
